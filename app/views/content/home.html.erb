    <p>The goal of Leverage is to empower citizens of Philadelphia to use campaign finance data when making informed decisions about who they donate to and who they vote for.</p>

    <p>The foundation of Leverage is the campaign finance data published by the City of Philadelphia. We will apply machine learning techniques to the data to pull out trends and patterns. Finally, we add a layer of simple visualization on top of the analyzed data, allowing any citizen to consume and understand how candidates are funded.</p>

    <p>The project will be on ongoing as we plan to implement feedback from users to improve the application's usefulness. We are currently in the prototype stage and we planning to have a working model in place this fall for the upcoming election cycle in November 2016.</p>

    <p>The three guiding principles of the application are to empower voters to make informed decisions, not to single out individual contributors (we're not doing this to facilitate punitive actions), and design visualizations so they can be used by non-English speakers and illiterate voters.</p>

    <p>Leverage will serve as a utility to voters as they assess candidates. We plan to provide a continuum of engagement options for voters depending on how much time they have to research candidates. A voter with less than an hour can consult a dashboard of visualizations for quick insights on their favorite candidates. Voters with more than an hour can set out on a more indepth analysis reviewing useful statistics in a multitude of categories.</p>
